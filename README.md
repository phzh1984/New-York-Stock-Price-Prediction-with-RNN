# New-York-Stock-Price-Prediction-with-RNN

Overview

Welcome to the New York Stock Price Prediction with RNN project! This repository contains data and code for predicting stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In this project, we aim to utilize historical stock price data, fundamental indicators, and machine learning techniques to make one-day ahead predictions of stock prices for S&P 500 companies. The dataset includes historical prices, fundamental data, and company descriptions.

Dataset

The dataset consists of the following files:

prices.csv: This file contains raw, as-is daily prices for S&P 500 companies. The data spans from 2010 to the end of 2016, although the date range may be shorter for companies 
newly listed on the stock market. Please note that this dataset does not account for approximately 140 stock splits that occurred during this time.

prices-split-adjusted.csv: Similar to prices.csv, but it includes adjustments for stock splits.

securities.csv: This file provides a general description of each company, including their respective sectors.

fundamentals.csv: Metrics extracted from annual SEC 10K filings from 2012 to 2016. These metrics are essential for deriving popular fundamental indicators.

Context

Stock trading is increasingly influenced by automated systems, with around 30% of stock market activity generated by machines. This project explores the possibility of fully automating trading by leveraging historical data. While it may not fully automate trading, we can learn valuable insights from the dataset. You can explore various aspects, including:

One-Day Ahead Prediction: Implement predictive models like Rolling Linear Regression, ARIMA, and Neural Networks (such as LSTM) to forecast stock prices one day ahead.

Momentum/Mean-Reversion Strategies: Analyze trading strategies based on momentum and mean-reversion to identify potential trading signals.

Security Clustering and Portfolio Construction: Group companies into clusters and construct diversified portfolios to optimize returns and manage risk.

Bankruptcy Risk Assessment: Identify companies with the highest likelihood of going bankrupt using financial indicators.

Valuation Analysis: Determine which companies might be undervalued by assessing how their stock prices behaved subsequently and calculating the Return on Investment (ROI).
